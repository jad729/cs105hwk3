Some rambling about CS126
I like Nakai's proposed new method of teaching where we focus class time on examples and read about the topic on our own time. 
I really enjoy the labs, they have been pretty challenging, which I find exciting. 
I am going to start working through the exercises in the book for more practice.
Hope I'm prepared for the test next week.
