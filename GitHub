I thought I would create one file just to explore the idea of GitHub as a tool.
It seems like a much easier way of interacting with repositories than Git itself. 
It seems like a versatile tool.  I wonder who else uses it besides programmers?
Researching GitHub, I found out it is owned by Microsoft.
Looking at all of its opensource projects is really interesting.
I will definitely explore it more in the future, when I'm a little better at programming.
